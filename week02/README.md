# Week 2: Bottom-Up Text Analysis – From Preprocessing to Vectorization  

This week, we delve deeper into computational text analysis, focusing on preprocessing techniques and methods for representing text data numerically. These steps are crucial for preparing textual data for machine learning and statistical analysis.  

## Topics
We will explore key preprocessing techniques, including:  

- **Stemming & Lemmatization** – Reducing words to their base or root form  
- **Text Normalization** – Lowercasing, removing punctuation, and handling special characters  

Additionally, we will discuss:  

- **Bag-of-Words (BoW) and TF-IDF** – Traditional text vectorization techniques  
- **Word Embeddings** – Moving beyond BoW with distributed representations of words
