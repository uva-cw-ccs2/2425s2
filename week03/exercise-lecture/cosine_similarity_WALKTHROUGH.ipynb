    "### In a next step, you can investigate how cosine similiary scores differ after applying preprocessing steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why can preprocessing improves cosine similarity?\n",
    "\n",
    "When comparing text similarity using vectorizers like `CountVectorizer` or `TfidfVectorizer`, **preprocessing the text** can significantly improve the results. Here's why:\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Preprocessing Does\n",
    "\n",
    "| Preprocessing Step     | Purpose |\n",
    "|------------------------|---------|\n",
    "| **Lowercasing**        | Makes \"The\" and \"the\" identical |\n",
    "| **Tokenization**       | Breaks text into words for further processing |\n",
    "| **Stopword Removal**   | Removes common, non-informative words like \"the\", \"is\", etc. |\n",
    "| **Stemming**           | Reduces words to their root form (e.g., \"loved\" → \"love\") |\n",
    "\n",
    "### How this helps cosine similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "Cosine similarity measures the **angle between two vectors** — not their length. Cleaned and normalized vectors are:\n",
    "- More compact\n",
    "- Less noisy\n",
    "- More focused on the meaningful content words\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to **more accurate similarity comparisons** between texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "Raw: \"The movie is amazing!\" Cleaned: \"movi amaz\"\n",
    "Both \"The movie is amazing!\" and \"An amazing movie indeed.\" will reduce to something like `[\"movi\", \"amaz\"]`, making them more likely to match.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### When NOT to preprocess\n",
    "\n",
    "When using embeddings (for Soft Cosine), extensive preprocessing, like stemming or stopword removal, is not needed!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "> Use basic preprocessing (lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword removal, stemming) when working with `CountVectorizer` or `TfidfVectorizer` for better cosine similarity -- but not when using `spacy Embeddings` for soft cosine."
