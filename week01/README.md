# Week 1  

This week, we'll begin by introducing the course and outlining its structure. We'll also explore the world of **computational text analysis**, focusing on essential **natural language processing (NLP)** techniques needed to process our data effectively.  

Specifically, we'll cover key techniques such as:  
- **Tokenization**  
- **Stopword removal**  

These fundamental methods help clean and prepare data for further analysis.
